Marnie's Thumbprint Cookies	When Marnie Was There 	Vanilla and berry sugar cookie	"1.5*cups*Flour,  0.25*teaspoon*Salt, 0.75*cup*Butter (Room temp), 0.5*cup*Sugar, 1*null*Egg, 0.5*teaspoon*Vanilla Extract, 0*null*Raspberry or Strawberry or Chery Preserves,0*null*Sifted Powdered Sugar (Optional)"	"1. In a medium bowl, whisk the salt into the flour. In a large mixing bowl on med-high speed, cream together the butter & sugar until light & fluffy. Mix in the egg & flavoring until fully combined. Turn the speed to low & gradually add in the flour & beat until a smooth dough is formed. Lay out a large sheet of plastic wrap & plop the cookie dough into the center. Wrap the dough & shape it into a log about 1 1/2"" in diameter. Wrap it again is foil & then place it in the fridge for a couple hours or overnight./2. Line 2 large trays with parchment. Remove the dough from the fridge & cut it into even slices between 1/4"" -1/2"" wide (this will give you uniform cookies). Roll 1 slice at a time in the palms of your hands to make dough balls & place them on the trays about 2"" apart. Press your thumb into the center of each ball to make a decent indentation, being careful not to go all the way through to the tray below (also, having short thumb nails is best). If the sides crack, simply press them back together./3. If you're using fruit preserves for the center, spoon a small amount into each thumbprint. Do not mound up the preserves, just let it be a flat little pool. If you're using candied cherries, simply cut them in half & nestle one half-round side up-into each thumbprint. If using maraschino cherries, do the same thing after you've drained & patted/gently squeezed them dry./4. Chill the cookie trays in the fridge while your oven preheats to 350degreesF. Bake 1 tray at a time on the middle rack for about 12 minutes, or until the cookie bottoms are just beginning to golden. Remove from the oven & gently transfer the cookies to a cooling rack. If you'd like to sprinkle sugar over the cookies (gives them a more Christmas-y vibe), place the cooling rack over the empty baking tray & dust the cookies with sifted powdered sugar, & then let cool. To store, place in an airtight container with wax paper."	720	Medium

Gather all the ingredients. I follow a rice-to-water ratio of 1 to 5 for a thicker consistency in this recipe; to adjust for a runnier consistency, please see the Notes at the end of the recipe card./2. Rinse 0.25 cup uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice in water, then drain. Repeat until the water runs clear. Drain into a colander and shake off the excess water./3. Add the well-drained rice and 250 ml water to a heavy-bottomed pot or a donabe earthenware pot, as I have here. If cooking in a donabe, use a towel to wipe off any excess water on the bottom of the pot (or else it may crack under heat). Tip: Select a cooking pot with plenty of room for the rice and water to cook without boiling over./4. Soak the rice for at least 30 minutes./5. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat./5. Once boiling, lower the heat to the stove's lowest setting (make sure to use the right size of stove burner for your pot size). Open the lid and gently mix with a spoon, making sure the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pot./6. Then, cover with the lid and gently simmer the rice for 30 minutes. During this time, I do not open the lid or mix the rice. Tip: With a good size pot and the lowest heat on the stove, the water should not boil over. If you cook with more water or your pot is smaller than mine, you may want to leave the lid slightly ajar so the water doesn't boil over. Tip: If you are worried, you can take a quick peek to make sure there's enough water so the rice doesn't burn on the bottom of the pot. If necessary, you can stir the rice or add a bit of hot water. Otherwise, don't stir the rice because that may break the rice grains./7. After 30 minutes, turn off the heat and let it steam with the lid on for 10 minutes. The rice porridge should be soft and thick. If you want to add a beaten egg or salt, this is the time to mix it in. I keep this recipe plain and simple. Serve in individual rice bowls and garnish with toppings of your choice./8. You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and keep them for 2 days in the refrigerator or for up to a month in the freezer. "	65	Easy

Set the salmon mix and nori aside./2. Put the cookie cutter on a flat surface. Place an 8""x8"" sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie cutter and push some of it it down inside so that the inside of the cookie cutter is completely lined with plastic wrap. Scoop approximately 2 tbsp of rice into the bottom of the cutter and press it flat with a plastic spoon or small rubber spatula (the rice won't stick to the tools as much as it sticks to fingers!). When flattening the rice, push it around so that it reaches right up to the corners of the cutter (add more rice if needed to make sure the bottom is completely coated). Place 1 tsp salmon filling into the middle of the rice, spreading it around just a little, so there will be a little salmon in each bite of rice when you're finished./3. Place a couple more tablespoons of rice on top and flatten out as before. Add a little extra rice if you need more to cover up the salmon. Wrap the plastic tightly over the exposed end of the onigiri and pop it out of the cookie cutter. Firmly wrap any loose ends around the outside of the onigiri. Set aside. /4. Repeat with remaining rice and salmon until you run out of ingredients (for me, this made 12 rice balls)./5. Let the onigiri set for 5-10 minutes. If planning to eat them later, place them on a baking sheet and chill until ready to serve (you can reheat them in the microwave inside the plastic wrap for no more than 20-25 seconds - if they get too hot, they can fall apart). /6. When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and press a nori strip around the bottom of each onigiri. The rice should still be sticky enough that the nori adheres with no problems."	15	Easy

Remove the scales on both sides of the fish by sliding the tip of the knife from the tail end towards the head./2. Place the knife where the tail begins, facing the blade to the head. Move the knife at a very low angle towards the head and trim the bony scales (scutes) along the lateral line, which ends close to half-way./3. Remove the head by cutting at a slight angle behind the gill and the front fin./4. Using a finger or a narrow knife, remove the guts from the opening, without breaking the thin flesh around the belly./5. Rinse the fish and clean the cavity in the belly. Pat dry, including inside the cavity. /6. Starting from the head of the fish, make a shallow incision on the dorsal side all the way to the tail. The incision needs to be on your side of the back bones./7. Using the tip of the knife, extend the incision towards the belly along the backbones. It is easier if you lift the flesh that is already removed from the bones so that you can see where your knife is cutting./8. Detach the rib cage by cutting the rib bones along the back bones./9. Continue to remove the flesh along the back bones until you reach to the belly, but keep the belly skin intact. You now have a butterflied fish with the bone in./10. Flip the butterflied fish over (skin side up) and make an incision on the other side of the dorsal in the same way./11. Chop the backbone at the tail end, keeping the tail attached to the flesh./12. Now you have a butterflied fish fillet. If small pieces of guts are left on the belly, wipe them off using kitchen paper./13. Place the tip of the knife where the rib bones start and trim the flesh with the rib bones very thinly. Do the same on the other side of the rib bones./14. There is a very sharp hard thorn in front of the anal fin. You need to remove it. I used kitchen scissors for this./15. The last step is to remove the pin bones from the fillet. Run your finger along where the backbone was and feel the bones to locate them. Remove all of them using a pair of fish bone tweezers or pliers./16. Sprinkle salt and pepper over both sides of butterflied fish fillets./17. Working one fillet at a time, coat a fillet with flour, then pat to shake off excess flour. Place it in the egg and coat all over. Allow excess egg to drip, then transfer to the breadcrumbs./18. Cover the entire fish with breadcrumbs, and gently press down so that a good layer of breadcrumbs is stuck on both sides. Repeat for the rest of the fillets./19. Heat oil in a frying pan to 170 degrees C / 338 degrees F. The oil should be about 3cm / 1.25"" deep./20. Gently place the crumbed fish skin side up. Do not crowd the oil with too many fish pieces. Cook for about 1-1.5 minutes, then turn the fish over. Cook for further 1 minutes or so, until golden brown./21. Transfer the fried fish to a tray lined with kitchen paper to drain excess oil./22.

Optionally, you can shave the edges of each piece to round them off. This cutting method is called mentori. Put the cut up potato in a bowl of water, and then drain to rinse off the surface starch/3. Cut the shiitake mushtooms: tightly squeeze out the rehydrated dried shiitake mushrooms, saving the soaking liquid. Cut off the stem, which is usually too chewy even after rehydrating. Cut each cap in half - but instead of just going straight up and down, make a slanted 45 degree cut./4. Cut the onion into 1/8th wedges./5. Heat up your pan with the teaspoon of oil.  Put the onions in first and stir around for 2-3 minutes until the edges start turning a bit translucent./5. Add the potatoes and carrots and continue stirring for a minute. This short sauteing step helps to bring out the sweetness of the vegetables. Add the mushrooms and stir a bit more./6. Add the dashi stock (or combined dashi + mushroom soaking liquid). There should be enough to just about come to the top level of all the vegetables in the pot./7. Bring it up to a boil and lower the heat to a simmer. Some scum will rise to the top, which should be removed so that the final dish will have a clean taste and appearance. Try to take off just the scum and leave the liquid. /8. Add the flavoring ingredients in this order: sugar, mirin, sake, and then finally the soy sauce./9. Let simmer on its own. In the meantime, blanch the peas in boiling water for a minute or two./10. Arrange the vegetables attractively in a bowl, pouring a little of the cooking liquid over it to add shine and flavor. Garnish with the snow peas or other green garnish of your choice to make it ""pop"". "	40	Easy
