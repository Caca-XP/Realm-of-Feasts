Marnie's Thumbprint Cookies	Studio Ghibli: When Marnie Was There 	Vanilla and berry sugar cookie	"1.5*cups*Flour,  0.25*teaspoon*Salt, 0.75*cup*Butter (Room temp), 0.5*cup*Sugar, 1*null*Egg, 0.5*teaspoon*Vanilla Extract, 0*null*Raspberry or Strawberry or Chery Preserves,0*null*Sifted Powdered Sugar (Optional)"	"1. In a medium bowl, whisk the salt into the flour. In a large mixing bowl on med-high speed, cream together the butter & sugar until light & fluffy. Mix in the egg & flavoring until fully combined. Turn the speed to low & gradually add in the flour & beat until a smooth dough is formed. Lay out a large sheet of plastic wrap & plop the cookie dough into the center. Wrap the dough & shape it into a log about 1.5 inches in diameter. Wrap it again is foil & then place it in the fridge for a couple hours or overnight.||2. Line 2 large trays with parchment. Remove the dough from the fridge & cut it into even slices between 0.25 inches - 0.5 inches wide (this will give you uniform cookies). Roll 1 slice at a time in the palms of your hands to make dough balls & place them on the trays about 2 inches apart. Press your thumb into the center of each ball to make a decent indentation, being careful not to go all the way through to the tray below (also, having short thumb nails is best). If the sides crack, simply press them back together.||3. If you're using fruit preserves for the center, spoon a small amount into each thumbprint. Do not mound up the preserves, just let it be a flat little pool. If you're using candied cherries, simply cut them in half & nestle one half-round side up-into each thumbprint. If using maraschino cherries, do the same thing after you've drained & patted||gently squeezed them dry.||4. Chill the cookie trays in the fridge while your oven preheats to 350degreesF. Bake 1 tray at a time on the middle rack for about 12 minutes, or until the cookie bottoms are just beginning to golden. Remove from the oven & gently transfer the cookies to a cooling rack. If you'd like to sprinkle sugar over the cookies (gives them a more Christmas-y vibe), place the cooling rack over the empty baking tray & dust the cookies with sifted powdered sugar, & then let cool. To store, place in an airtight container with wax paper."	720	Medium

Rice Porridge (Okayu)	Studio Ghibli: Princess Mononoke	Simple and traditional savoury porridge	"0.25*cup*Uncooked Short Grain Rice, 250*mL*Water, 0*null*Chopped Scallion, 0*null*Umeboshi (Pickled Plums), 0*null*Toasted White Sesame Seeds, 0*null*Kizami Nori (Shredded Nori Seaweed), 0*null*Bonito Flakes (Flaked Japanese Salted Salmon), 0*null*Mitsuba (Japanese Parsley)"	"1. Gather all the ingredients. I follow a rice-to-water ratio of 1 to 5 for a thicker consistency in this recipe; to adjust for a runnier consistency, please see the Notes at the end of the recipe card.||2. Rinse 0.25 cup uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice in water, then drain. Repeat until the water runs clear. Drain into a colander and shake off the excess water.||3. Add the well-drained rice and 250 ml water to a heavy-bottomed pot or a donabe earthenware pot, as I have here. If cooking in a donabe, use a towel to wipe off any excess water on the bottom of the pot (or else it may crack under heat). Tip: Select a cooking pot with plenty of room for the rice and water to cook without boiling over.||4. Soak the rice for at least 30 minutes.||5. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat.||5. Once boiling, lower the heat to the stove's lowest setting (make sure to use the right size of stove burner for your pot size). Open the lid and gently mix with a spoon, making sure the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pot.||6. Then, cover with the lid and gently simmer the rice for 30 minutes. During this time, I do not open the lid or mix the rice. Tip: With a good size pot and the lowest heat on the stove, the water should not boil over. If you cook with more water or your pot is smaller than mine, you may want to leave the lid slightly ajar so the water doesn't boil over. Tip: If you are worried, you can take a quick peek to make sure there's enough water so the rice doesn't burn on the bottom of the pot. If necessary, you can stir the rice or add a bit of hot water. Otherwise, don't stir the rice because that may break the rice grains.||7. After 30 minutes, turn off the heat and let it steam with the lid on for 10 minutes. The rice porridge should be soft and thick. If you want to add a beaten egg or salt, this is the time to mix it in. I keep this recipe plain and simple. Serve in individual rice bowls and garnish with toppings of your choice.||8. You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and keep them for 2 days in the refrigerator or for up to a month in the freezer. "	65	Easy

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand (or in a stand mixer) for 10 minutes or until soft, smooth and elastic.||3. Lightly coat a bowl in oil and transfer in your dough. Toss the dough in the bowl to ensure it's fully coated in oil. Cover and allow to proof until doubled in size (about an hour).||4. Uncover the dough and knock out the air. Flatten the dough into a large disc and make a well in the centre. Add the baking powder into the well and gather the edges of the dough towards the centre to enclose the baking powder.||5. Knead the dough for a few minutes or until the baking powder is well distributed into the dough. Flatten the dough and then divide the dough into 6 to 12 even pieces, cover any dough that isn't being used to prevent it from drying out.||6. Pat out your portioned dough into a disc and spread over a layer of red bean paste. Cup the dough in both hands and gently rotate the dough until the edges are nearly touching. Gather the edges together and twist to seal. Invert the dough so that the seam is on your work surface. Gently roll it around to help tighten that seal. Cover and rest the buns for another 20 minutes. Line your steamers and bring water to a boil in a saucepan during that time.||7. Transfer the buns into a steamer lined with some baking paper, making sure to leave space between each bun as they will expand. Cover with a lid, place the steamer onto your saucepan, reduce heat to a simmer and allow to steam, undisturbed for 12 to 15 minutes (20 minutes if you want to make a massive one). Remove from heat and allow to rest for 5 minutes before opening the lid. Eat them while they're still warm! "	120	Medium						
Onigiri	Studio Ghibli: Spirited Away	Japanese rice balls 	"6*sheets*Roasted Seaweed (Nori), 0.75*cup*Shredded Cooked Salmon, 1*tablespoon*Mayonnaise, 6*cups*Cooked Sticky Rice, 1*null*Triangle-shaped Cookie Cutter"	"1. Start by slicing your nori sheets in half lengthwise. My sheets were 2.5 inches x 3.5 inches, so in the end I had 12 strips that were 1.25 inches wide. Mix the mayonnaise into your salmon until well coated. Set the salmon mix and nori aside.||2. Put the cookie cutter on a flat surface. Place an 8x8 inches sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie cutter and push some of it it down inside so that the inside of the cookie cutter is completely lined with plastic wrap. Scoop approximately 2 tbsp of rice into the bottom of the cutter and press it flat with a plastic spoon or small rubber spatula (the rice won't stick to the tools as much as it sticks to fingers!). When flattening the rice, push it around so that it reaches right up to the corners of the cutter (add more rice if needed to make sure the bottom is completely coated). Place 1 tsp salmon filling into the middle of the rice, spreading it around just a little, so there will be a little salmon in each bite of rice when you're finished.||3. Place a couple more tablespoons of rice on top and flatten out as before. Add a little extra rice if you need more to cover up the salmon. Wrap the plastic tightly over the exposed end of the onigiri and pop it out of the cookie cutter. Firmly wrap any loose ends around the outside of the onigiri. Set aside. ||4. Repeat with remaining rice and salmon until you run out of ingredients (for me, this made 12 rice balls).||5. Let the onigiri set for 5-10 minutes. If planning to eat them later, place them on a baking sheet and chill until ready to serve (you can reheat them in the microwave inside the plastic wrap for no more than 20-25 seconds - if they get too hot, they can fall apart). ||6. When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and press a nori strip around the bottom of each onigiri. The rice should still be sticky enough that the nori adheres with no problems."	15	Easy

Remove the scales on both sides of the fish by sliding the tip of the knife from the tail end towards the head.||2. Place the knife where the tail begins, facing the blade to the head. Move the knife at a very low angle towards the head and trim the bony scales (scutes) along the lateral line, which ends close to half-way.||3. Remove the head by cutting at a slight angle behind the gill and the front fin.||4. Using a finger or a narrow knife, remove the guts from the opening, without breaking the thin flesh around the belly.||5. Rinse the fish and clean the cavity in the belly. Pat dry, including inside the cavity. ||6. Starting from the head of the fish, make a shallow incision on the dorsal side all the way to the tail. The incision needs to be on your side of the back bones.||7. Using the tip of the knife, extend the incision towards the belly along the backbones. It is easier if you lift the flesh that is already removed from the bones so that you can see where your knife is cutting.||8. Detach the rib cage by cutting the rib bones along the back bones.||9. Continue to remove the flesh along the back bones until you reach to the belly, but keep the belly skin intact. You now have a butterflied fish with the bone in.||10. Flip the butterflied fish over (skin side up) and make an incision on the other side of the dorsal in the same way.||11. Chop the backbone at the tail end, keeping the tail attached to the flesh.||12. Now you have a butterflied fish fillet. If small pieces of guts are left on the belly, wipe them off using kitchen paper.||13. Place the tip of the knife where the rib bones start and trim the flesh with the rib bones very thinly. Do the same on the other side of the rib bones.||14. There is a very sharp hard thorn in front of the anal fin. You need to remove it. I used kitchen scissors for this.||15. The last step is to remove the pin bones from the fillet. Run your finger along where the backbone was and feel the bones to locate them. Remove all of them using a pair of fish bone tweezers or pliers.||16. Sprinkle salt and pepper over both sides of butterflied fish fillets.||17. Working one fillet at a time, coat a fillet with flour, then pat to shake off excess flour. Place it in the egg and coat all over. Allow excess egg to drip, then transfer to the breadcrumbs.||18. Cover the entire fish with breadcrumbs, and gently press down so that a good layer of breadcrumbs is stuck on both sides. Repeat for the rest of the fillets.||19. Heat oil in a frying pan to 170 degrees C || 338 degrees F. The oil should be about 3cm || 1.25 inches deep.||20. Gently place the crumbed fish skin side up. Do not crowd the oil with too many fish pieces. Cook for about 1-1.5 minutes, then turn the fish over. Cook for further 1 minutes or so, until golden brown.||21.

Start by peeling and shredding your apple until it could be mistaken for raw hash browns. Mix the shredded apple with the butter, eggs, and milk.||2.   In another bowl, whisk together your flour, baking powder, cinnamon, sugar, and salt.||3.   Once your dry goods are blended, add them to the apple mix. Throw in the cherries while you're at it. Mix everything together until it just combines into a batter. No need to over mix it.||4. Lower heat and longer cooking times are the keys to making lovely golden brown griddle cakes that flip easily with no mess. The faster and hotter you cook them, the more likely they are to wind up burned at the edges and raw in the middle. Cook these over medium heat - no hotter.||6.   Pour a single large cake into the middle of the skillet using half a cup of batter.||7.   Generously smear the skillet with butter before adding the batter. Instead of watching the time, watch the griddle cakes. When the edges start to lift up from the pan and bubbles rise to the surface of the middle, they're ready to flip. Any sooner than that and you'll wind up with a wet, sloppy mess stretched across your pan.||8.  After flipping, brown your cakes for another 3-4 minutes to finish them.||9.  Sprinkle the hot cakes with extra sugar and cinnamon or spread them with fresh raspberry jam. If you have extras, store them in the fridge overnight then reheat in a 350F / 180C oven for 5-6 minutes."	40	Easy

Soak your assorted dried fruits in half a cup of Guinness overnight to help plump them back up. ||2. Start by creaming together your room temperature butter, sugar, and eggs. Add the juice and zest of one orange.||3.   In another bowl, mix your flour, baking powder, and all the spices.||4.   Roll your moist fruit in the flour mix. If you can get a nice coating of flour on it, that will help keep the fruit from sinking to the bottom of the cake while it bakes.||5.Once your fruit is all floured up, introduce the flour mix to the butter mix. Take them on a nice little dance around your bowl until they're all mixed up. Once they're happily confused, pour in all the beer. Keep mixing until the foam dies down.||6. Generously grease a couple of 22 cm cake pans. Square pans make for easy cutting and dense packing, but you're just as welcome to use round pans.||7.  Pour your batter into the buttery pans and give them a nice shake to help smooth out the crust.||8.   Sprinkle the brown sugar evenly over your cakes. Top that with an even sprinkling of thin flaked almond slices. Use your fingers to gently press the almonds into the batter. This will help prevent them from escaping when you slice the cake.||9.   Bake at 325F / 160C for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is a dark, crunchy brown and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.||10.

"Braided Bread Stuffed with Mushrooms, Onions, and Cheese"	The Hobbit 	Hobbit stuffed bread	"1.5*cups*Water,1*tablespoon*Active Dry Yeast,4*tablespoons*Honey,4*null*Eggs,0.5*cup*Oil,7*cups*Bread Flour,1*tablespoon*Coarse Salt,8*cloves*Minced Garlic,1*tablespoon*Fresh Rosemary Leaves,1*teaspoon*Fresh Basil Leaves (minced),2*tablespoons*Butter,2*cups*Slice Mushrooms,2*null*Onions (diced),2*cups*Shredded Mozzarella,2*cloves*Garlic (filling),1*tablespoon*Rosemary (filling),1*teaspoon*Basil (filling),1*tablespoon*Coarse Salt (filling)"	"1. To make a loaf, start by dissolving your yeast in the warm water. Feel free to add an extra tsp of honey at this stage to help kick start your yeast.||2. Walk away for ten minutes. When you come back, the yeast should have bloomed so it looks like a mushroom cap rising up out of your bowl.||3.  Mix in the eggs, oil, salt, and the rest of the honey. When you achieve a soupy mass, add the minced garlic, fresh rosemary leaves, and fresh basil. ||4.   Now mix in the bread flour. Modern cooks with a stand mixer can attach the dough hook and let it knead away for 6-8 minutes. If you want to get a real feel for the period, knead it by hand for 8-10 minutes. The dough should be soft, pliant, and not too tacky.||5.  Form it into a ball, cover it with a clean dishtowel, and let it rise for an hour, or until doubles in size.||6. Meanwhile, make your filling. Melt your butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add your onions and cook until they start to brown. You want them to lose a lot of moisture while gaining some flavour. Once the onions start to brown, add your garlic, rosemary, and basil. Keep cooking for another 3-4 minutes, or until the garlic barely starts to brown. Finally, add the mushrooms. You don't want to overcook them. Mix them in and cook for another 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently. Take the pan off the heat and finish it with the coarse salt. Set it aside to cool while the dough continues rising.||7. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down. Flour a clean surface and roll the dough into a rectangle. Put that rectangle on a sheet of parchment paper so you can easily move the finished loaf to a pan. Trim away any rough edges.||8.  Now that you have a trimmed rectangle of dough, mentally divide the rectangle into thirds. The centre third is where you place your filling. The outer two thirds will be cut into braid strips. To give it an attractive, braided top, make neat, even, 1 inch wide cuts along each side.||9.  Make a bed of cheese in the middle of a third of your bread. Pile the mushroom filling on top of that. Cover the filling with any remaining cheese.||10. Fold both end pieces inwards so they cover some of the filling. To create the braided top, pull the cut edges of the dough over the centre, alternating sides and tugging tight, so the dough completely covers the filling.||11. This makes a single, massive rectangular loaf. Slide it onto your largest cooking pan. If you don't have any oversized baking sheets, just slide it into a heavily buttered 9x13 glass baking pan. Either way, let it rise for another hour.||12.  You put this much work into it, so you might as well make the bread pretty. Whisk together an egg and 1 tbsp of water to make an egg wash. Use a pastry brush to paint the surface of the bread. If you'd like, sprinkle another 1 tsp of coarse salt on top.||13. Bake the bread at 350F / 180C for 35-40 minutes. If the top starts to get too brown, cover it with foil.||14. Due to the moist interior, the bottom of this bread tends to get soggy if you leave it out overnight. That means it's your duty to consume the entire loaf before bedtime. If you don't have a party of dwarves or a couple of teenagers on hand to help you finish it, you can always use the leftovers to make savoury mushroom bread pudding for tomorrow's dinner."	180	Hard						
Pan Fried Tater Cakes with 	The Hobbit 	Crispy Potato Cakes	"1*cup*Potatoes (shredded),2*cups*Potatoes (Mashed),1*cup*Flour,1*large*Onion (minced),0.5*cup*Cheddar (shredded),0.25*cup*Whole Milk,2*cloves*Garlic (minced),1*tablespoon*Coarse Salt,1*teaspoon*Fresh Ground Black Pepper,10*tablespoon*Butter (softened)"	"1.  Peel and grate your raw potatoes. To reduce the starch, soak them in cold water for five minutes. Don't skip this step. It makes a big difference. While the raw potatoes are soaking, mix your leftover mashed potatoes, flour, minced onion, minced garlic, salt, pepper, milk, shredded cheese and softened butter. You should end up with something a little thicker than lumpy pancake batter. Drain your raw potato shreds, give them one last rinse, and mix them into the batter.||2. Melt a tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium heat - no hotter! Drop in a heaping tbsp full of batter and use the back of a spoon to flatten it slightly. You should be able to fry 3 potato cakes in a round pan or four in a square one.||3.   Here's the hard part. Once your potato cakes are nice and round, leave them alone. Let them sizzle away over a medium heat for about ten minutes. If your first batch starts to burn before 10 minutes are up, turn down the heat.||4.  When you flip the tater cakes, the bottom side should be a lovely dark golden brown. Let them crisp up for another 6-8 minutes on the second side.||5.   Since they are a bit time consuming, don't be afraid of making two pans at once. Just stagger the flipping. Put down three potato cakes in the first pan. Wait five minutes, put three in a second pan, and wait five more five minutes. You can get into a good rhythm of flipping one skillet and adding new batter to the other.||6.  In addition to making great gravy sops, these small, round potato cakes also taste surprisingly good with a sprinkle of coarse salt and a dollop of fresh applesauce."	35	Medium

Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make sure the baking powder is evenly distributed in the salt or else you'll end up with unevenly cooked bannocks.||2.   Now add the sugar, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves. Mix in the sugar and spices until everything is well blended. Next, add in the oats and give them a good mix.||3. Get it all wet by adding the milk. Stir it just enough to make the lumps disappear. You don't need to overwork this batter.||4.  Heat a large cast iron skillet or griddle to medium heat. You want to cook these low and slow to avoid burning. Smear the bottom with a generous coat of butter. Honestly, the easiest method is to just rub the stick across the surface of your hot pan.||5.  Ladle in a third cup of batter. You should be able to comfortably fit three at a time into a round skillet or four onto a square griddle.||6.  Fry for 3-5 minutes per side, or until they're a dark golden brown.||7. These are best served warm with a nice cup of milky tea. If you want to make them up in advance, you can reheat them without burning the surface by arranging a single layer on a lined baking sheet and popping them in a 400F / 205C oven for 5-6 minutes, or until warmed through but not yet overly crispy on the outside."	40	Medium

Start by making the cobbler topping. Instead of a full pastry crust, you're essentially making savoury biscuits which will be a crunchy golden brown on top and full of brothy flavour on the bottom.||2.  Mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and thyme in a large bowl. Cut your butter into cubes and work it into the flour until it achieves the texture of gravel. Now moisten that gravel into a dough by adding the milk, a little at a time, until you end up with a dough similar to American biscuits.||3. Knead the dough a couple of times for good measure, then cover it with a towel and set it in the fridge while you make the cobbler filling.||4.  Preheat your oven to 400F / 205C. While the oven heats up, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Gently fry the onions and celery for 4-5 minutes, or until the onion barely starts to brown.||5.  Add the browned onions and celery to a rectangular baking pan. Now add the cubed venison to the skillet and brown it in batches. Don't overcrowd the pan.||6.   When the venison is browned, send it to join the onions in your baking pan. Add the cubed carrots to keep it company.||7. Whisk the flour into the beef broth until it's completely dissolved and free of lumps. Now mix in the Worcestershire, mustard powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Once those are well blended, add the red currant or cherry jelly and keep whisking until you achieve a thick, sweet broth.||8. Once your jelly is mixed into the broth, pour in the ale and give it all a casual stir. Drop in the bay leaves.||9. Go back to your pan of meat and veggies. Give them all one more good stir before gently pouring the liquids over the solids. Shake the pan a couple of times to settle everything.||10.  It's now time to top it with the 'cobblers.' Fetch your dough from the fridge and use your hands to press it down until it's about 1 inch / 2.5 cm thick. The cobbles will inflate in the oven, so you don't want them to be too thick.||11. Use a 3 inch / 7.5 cm round cookie cutter to cut out your cobbles. Welcome to use any fancy shaped cookie cutter you'd like. The point is to cover the entire surface in evenly sized increments to make a nice presentation. The easiest way to do this is to slightly overlap each cobble so it looks more like roofing shingles than street paving stones.||12. Whisk your egg and remaining 1 tbsp of milk together until smooth. Very carefully paint the glaze over the topping.||13.   Carefully place your dish in the oven. (Try not to slosh too much broth over the top of the cobbles.) Bake for 30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the interior is bubbly.||14.   Take it out of the oven and let the cobbler sit for at least 10 minutes to cool and settle before serving."	100	Hard

You don't want hearty sausage links here. Get loose, ground country sausage (you can find it in the butcher section of larger groceries) . You want a loose grind full of delicious fat to bind the filling together.||2. Brown the sausage and remove it from the skillet. Add the onion to all that tasty grease. Cook it until the onion has sweated out most of its moisture (this helps the pies keep from getting too mushy) and start to turn a nice brown at the edges.||3. Once your onions are browned, turn the heat down to medium. Return the sausage to the pan and add in the thyme, allspice, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix well, so everything is coated, and keep cooking for another 1-2 minutes. Now sprinkle the flour over the top of the mixture. Patiently let it soak in for about a minute before you start stirring. This should thicken up the filling and help bind it together. Take the filling off the heat and let it cool to room temperature before stuffing your pies.||4. You want to roll your short crust pastry dough out until it's no less than a quarter to eighth inch / 3-6 mm thick. Use a 4 inch / 10 cm wide cookie cutter to cut it into large rounds. If you're making a big batch of different pies and don't want the first bite of everyone to be a surprise, have fun using different shaped cookie cutters for each filling.||5.  Whatever shape you use, tightly pack 2 tbsp of filling into the middle of your crust. Fold the crust over, pinch it tight, and crimp the edges tightly closed. Once the edges are crimped, punch a couple of holes in the top for steam to escape. Arrange your hand pies 1-2 inches / 2.5-5 cm apart on a well greased cookie sheet.||6. Whisk 1 egg plus 1 tbsp of water together. Use a pastry brush to paint the tops of your hand pies. Once they're shiny and beautiful, bake them at 375F / 190C for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown."	80	Hard						
Wine Braised Oxtails	The Hobbit 	Oxtails braised in a wine broth 	"1.3*kilograms*Oxtails,1*tablespoon*Butter,2*cups*Red Wine,2*cups*Beef Broth,2*null*Bay Leaves,2*sprigs*Fresh Rosemary,1*whole*Onion (peeled),6*cloves*Garlic (peeled and crushed)"	"1. Melt 1 tbsp butter in a Dutch oven or large, sturdy stockpot. Over medium-high heat, brown the oxtails on all sides. Make sure to brown the fatty side. That adds a lot of flavor.||2. Once your oxtails are browned up, drown them in red wine and broth. Add the bay leaves, fresh rosemary, crushed garlic cloves, and whole, peeled onion. You can tuck them in a cheesecloth sachet if you'd like to keep things tidy, but it's not strictly necessary.||3.   When the wine and broth mix comes to a boil, put the lid on your Dutch oven. Reduce the heat to low and let it continue simmering for the next 2 hours. Check on the oxtails every half an hour or so to baste them in the cooking liquid.||4.  If you want to make a stew of it, after two hours of cooking, add 3 lbs / 1.3 kg peeled carrots, potatoes, turnips, or the root veggies of your choice. Make sure they're all cut into equal sized pieces no more than 2 inches / 5 cm. Bring the pot back to a boil, then turn the heat down to low and keep simmering for the next 30-45 minutes, or until the veggies are all soft, but not yet falling apart.||5.  If you don't want to make a stew of it, just simmer the oxtails for 2 hours and 45 minutes, or until they're so tender the meat nearly falls off the bone.||6. Now you have a couple of choices. If you're feeling extra rustic, you can serve the oxtails whole and let people pick at them to find all the good bits. However, if you have guests who are a little squeamish about seeing an actual piece of bone on their plate, go ahead and pull the meat off the bone for them. If you're making a stew, pile the meat on top of the vegetables right before serving.||7.  Before serving, remove 1 cup of fluid from the pot to use as a sauce. You can make an easy gravy by whisking together 2 tbsp flour with a third of a cup of cold water until the mix is free of lumps. Mix the cup of reserved juices into the cold flour water, whisking violently to keep it lump-free. Add salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce to spruce it back up.||8.  After dinner return the bones and other leftover bits of the oxtails to the pot. Fill it the rest of the way up with water and bring it back to a boil. You can add a couple of carrots and celery sticks for added flavour if you'd like. Let it boil while you entertain your guests at dinner, or for at least 2-3 hours. That gives it time to leach all the last flavour from the bones and marrow. If the night runs late, you can always put everything in a crockpot set to low and forget about it while you go to sleep.||9.  Either way, you now have delicious homemade beef broth you can use in anything. Take a sip and you'll never want to use store bought broth again. Strain out the solids and store it in the fridge for up to a week.||10.  If you're not in the mood to make broth from the leftovers, at least make sure to strain all the juices out of the pan left after making your gravy. You can make a simple, filling soup of it the next day by adding 1 part water to 1 part juices or just sop it up with stale bread for a truly lazy yet decadent snack."	180	Easy						
Frumenty Wheat Porridge	The Hobbit 	Medieval Wheat Porridge 	"1*tablespoon*Butter,1*cup*Bulgur Wheat,1*cup*Whole Milk,1*cups*Water,100*milliliters*Whole Cream,50*grams*Dried Cherries,50*grams*Currants,2*null*Egg Yolks (beaten),4*strands*Saffron,50*grams*Brown Sugar,0.5*tablespoon*Butter (topping),1*tablespoon*Pine Nuts,100*grams*Flaked Almonds,100*milliliter*Whole Cream (topping)"	"1. Melt your butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the wheat and stir constantly for about two minutes, or until all the grains are toasted. Turn the heat down to medium and add the water. Give that a good stir, then add the whole milk. If you add the milk first, you risk scalding it.||2. Keep stirring while you bring the pot to a gentle boil. Once it starts boiling, continue stirring regularly for 8-10 minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed and the wheat is tender. If your pot runs dry before the wheat has softened up, add another  60 ml of water and keep stirring it for another 5-6 minutes. Mix in the cherries and currants, then cover the pan and take it off the heat for 10 minutes so the wheat can cool.||3.  When you come back, mix in the heavy cream. You need to let the wheat cool before mixing in the cream or else you risk the dairy curdling. Now put the pot back over medium heat and slowly bring it back to a gentle boil. Stir frequently to keep anything from burning. Once the mix is boiling again, carefully stir in the beaten egg yolks. When they're well mixed, add the saffron strands and brown sugar. Keep mixing everything for another 1-2 minutes so the brown sugar melts into the porridge and the saffron strands have a chance to come in contact with as much of the grain as possible.||4. Remove the pan from the heat, cover it with a lid, and let it sit for 5-10 minutes for the flavours to mingle. While you wait, prepare the topping. Melt half tsp butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pine nuts and flaked almonds. Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes while the nuts toast. Be warned, if you look away for a second, pine nuts will instantly go from pale and chewy to burnt. Keep a close eye on them during the toasting.||5. To serve, fill bowls with frumenty, pour in a splash of cream, and top each one with a tbsp or two of freshly toasted nuts. If the expense and fuss of pine nuts are outside your budget, you can simply top the rich porridge with a splash of cream and plenty of dried cherries and currants."	60	Medium

To make this quick bread, start by creaming your eggs, sugar, and butter. Once those are a golden, sugary mass, add the milk and cream.||2.  In another bowl, mix your flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.||3.  Introduce your dry ingredients to your wet ingredients. Keep mixing until the batter is barely lump free.||4.   Now roughly chop up your leftover roast apples along with all their fillings. If you have any pan juice left from roasting the apples, you can add a couple of tbsp of it to the batter for extra flavour.||5.  Thoroughly butter up two loaf pans. Spoon a quarter of the batter into one pan. Top that with a quarter of the chopped apples and filling. Add another layer of batter then another layer of apples.||6.  This creates a nice line of apples down the middle. If you prefer yours with the apples a little more integrated, grab a butter knife and weave it back and forth in the batter a couple of times. The goal isn't a thorough mixing. You just want to muddle things up a little.||7.

Preheat your oven to 400F / 205C. While the oven heats up, whisk together your flour, baking powder, and salt.||2.  Mix the butter into the flour blend until you achieve a crumbly meal. Once it looks like gravel, add the lemon zest and blueberries or currants. Make sure it's all well blended.||3. In another bowl, beat the milk, egg, and 3/4 cup of honey until you get a nice, sloppy mess. Pour that into the crumbly flour blend and mix until the batter is just barely free of lumps. No need to overwork it or else you'll burst the blueberries.||4. Scoop about a third cup of the batter into heavily buttered muffin pan wells. You want to use a generous amount of butter instead of liners in order to achieve a nice, crispy crust.||5. For the first baking, leave them in a 400F / 205C oven for 12 minutes. They'll be ready to take out of the oven when the tops feel solid, but a toothpick stuck in the centre comes out a little sticky. If you use enough butter, the cakes should slide right out of the muffin tin. Arrange them 1 inch / 2.5 cm apart on a greased baking sheet.||6. Gently press a candied almond (or a plain one if you prefer) into the middle of each honey cake then generously drizzle the rest of your honey on top of the cakes. It helps to heat your honey in the microwave for 15-20 seconds to thin it out. Use enough to coat the top and let it drip down the sides. This creates a nice crispy glaze on your honey cakes. Once they're decorated with an almond crown and drizzled in sweetness, let the honey cakes sit for at least 5 minutes so the honey can soak in.||7.  Put the baking sheet back in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the tops are a deep golden honey brown.||8. While they're still perfectly edible days later, if you find yourself the host of an unexpected party, these honey cakes are quick to make and taste amazingly fresh from the oven with a bit of jam and clotted cream. They're even better the next day when the crust is nice and crispy and the interior is still soft and moist"	45	Easy

To make the filling, start by frying the bacon in a large skillet until it's crispy. Set the bacon aside on a plate. You now have a pan full of delicious bacon grease. Add the cubes of beef and brown them on all sides. You'll probably need to do this in 3-4 batches to keep from overcrowding the pan. As each batch of beef is browned up, add it to a Dutch oven.||2. Once your beef is all browned, melt the butter in your skillet. Add the sliced onions and let them cook over medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes, or until they start to soften. Toss in the chopped garlic cloves and keep cooking for another 3-4 minutes or until the garlic just barely starts to brown. Add the sprig of rosemary leaves, thyme, and fresh ground pepper. Keep cooking for another 1-2 minutes to release the flavour of the herbs.||3. You know, that beef looks lonely sitting by itself. Scrape your onion mix into the Dutch oven to keep it company. While you're at it, add in the carrots, ale, and beef stock.||4.  Bring the mix to a boil. Put a lid on it, reduce the heat down to medium-low, and let it simmer for about an hour and a half, or until the carrots are cooked through and the steak is tender.||5.  While the steak is cooking, mix up your pastry crust. This simple, dense crust adds amazing flavour - mostly because everything tastes better when drowned in butter. Mix the flour and salt. Now use your fingers to knead the flour into the butter until it resembles coarse gravel. Moisten that up by adding the beaten egg and 1 tbsp cold water. Keep mixing until you achieve a dense dough, then knead that a few times for good measure.||6. Divide your dough in half. Roll half of it until it's just large enough to cover the bottom of a well greased casserole dish or cake pan. Use a fork to poke a few holes in the bottom.||7. After a good 90 minute simmer, whisk together 2 tbsp flour and a quarter of a cup of cold water until you have no lumps. Gradually stir that into the stew to help thicken it.||8. After staring at that fried bacon for the last hour and a half, it's finally time to crumble it all up into the stew. Give the stew a hearty stir, then start ladling it into the casserole dish. Fill it 3 quarters of the way up. Any more than that and you risk it boiling over and spilling out the side of your dish. If you have any leftover, save it for individual pot pies.||9. Roll the remaining crust into a rectangle. Lay it on top of your casserole dish and pinch the edges closed. Trim off any excess.||10. Since you already went to all this effort, go ahead and knead the excess trimmed dough back into a ball. Roll it flat and use a small cookie cutter to cut out some attractive shapes. Use the extra dough to decorate the surface of your pie.||11. Whisk together an egg and 1 tbsp of water. Use a pastry brush to paint the egg wash on the surface of your pie crust. This will give it a lovely golden brown sheen.||12. Bake the pie at 400F / 205C for 30-35 minutes, or until the top crust is a dark, golden brown."	170	Medium						
Stewed Hare with Root Vegetables and Herb Dumpling	The Hobbit 	Hare stew with vegetable and dumpling side dishes 	"1*tablespoon*Butter,2*null*Onions ( diced),1*medium*Rabbit (skinned and quartered),2*null*Bay Leaves,1*teaspoon*Fresh Ground Black Pepper,2*teaspoon*Coarse Salt,1*teaspoon*Dried Tarragon,1*teaspoon*Dried Thyme,0.5*teaspoon*Dried Basil,5*cups*Water,4*large*Carrots (peeled and cut into large chunks),4*medium*Potatoes (peeled and cut into large chunks),1*large*Turnip (peeled and cut into large chunks),1*cup*Flour,120*grams* Cold Butter (dumpling),20*grams*Fresh Parsley (chopped),2*teaspoon*Baking Powder,0.5*teaspoon*Coarse Salt (dumpling),0.5*teaspoon*Black Pepper ( dumpling)"	"1.  Start by peeling your carrots, potatoes, and turnip. Cut the root veggies into equal sized large chunks of around 2 inches / 5 cm.||2.  It's time to get out your trusty Dutch oven again. If you don't have a Dutch oven, use your heartiest stock pot.||3.  Melt 1 tbsp butter or lard over medium-high heat. Once the fat is a liquid, carefully brown your rabbit quarters. Use a pair of tongs to take them out of the pot and add the chopped onion in their place. Cook the onion until it barely starts to brown, no more than 3-4 minutes. Add the salt, pepper, bay leaves, tarragon, thyme, and basil. Mix them in with the onions and keep cooking for another minute.||4.  Add all the water. Give it all a good, hearty stir. Since you're not using broth, you really want the herbs mixed in well. Now return your rabbit pieces to the pot and put a lid on it. Turn the heat down to medium-low. You want to get a nice simmer going. Don't let it come to a heavy boil. Let the hare and herbs simmer for 1 and a half hours, stirring once every 15 minutes or so.||5.   After an hour and a half, add the carrots, potatoes, and turnips. Give it all another good, hearty stir and put the lid back on. Let it keep cooking for another half hour.||6.  Meanwhile, prepare your dumplings. Mix the flour, salt, pepper, parsley, and baking powder. Now cut the butter into small pieces and add it in. Use your fingers to crumble the butter into the flour mix. Once you've made something akin to parsley flavoured gravel, add water, 1 tsp at a time, until you've got just enough to turn the gravel into a soft dough. Don't knead, squeeze, or overwork the dough. If you do, you'll get tough, chewy dumplings instead of soft, fluffy ones. Rip the dough into 8 smaller pieces.||7. Give your gently simmering stew one more hefty stir. Now carefully drop the 8 dumplings on top of the liquid. Don't fuss with it. Just drop in a dumpling and move along. It doesn't need to be perfect. Get them into the pot as quickly as possible and slap a lid on it.||8. Clamp the lid down tightly and leave it alone for 20 minutes. Do not raise the lid. If you let the steam escape, you'll ruin your dumplings.||9.  After 20 minutes, take the lid off and admire your handiwork. Use a slotted spoon to carefully lift the dumplings out of the broth. Now, because you're a nice person, fish out the bones. If your broth is too thin, you can boil it uncovered for a few minutes to thicken it up.||10.  Serve each person one hearty scoop of rabbit and veggies with two dumplings. Pour a little extra broth on top to keep it nice and creamy."	185	Medium						
Plum Heavies 	The Hobbit 	A small round cake made with an assortment of dried fruits 	"2.5*cups*Flour,1*cup*Butter (softened),0.5*cup*Sugar,0.5*cup*Minced Plums,2*tablespoons*Milk,1*teaspoon*Cinnamon,1*null*Egg (beaten)"	"1. Beat the butter, sugar, cinnamon, and milk until you have a dense, fatty mess. Sweeten it up by adding in your minced plums (or other fruit.) Once those are thoroughly integrated, add the flour.||2.  It's time to give up on stirring and just use your hands. Really work the flour into the buttery mix. Once everything is well integrated, knead the dough a few times for good measure.||3.  Roll the dough out to about a quarter inch / 6 mm thickness. Attack the dough with a small, round cookie cutter about 1and half inches / 3 cm wide. Remember, the goal here isn't a giant American cookie. It should be just big enough for 2-3 bites. These don't inflate much, so you can squeeze a lot of them onto a cookie sheet. Keep at it until you finally run out of dough.||4.  If you'd like, you can whisk an egg with a tbsp of water for a glaze. Use a pastry brush to paint it on top of the pastry bites. Follow that up with a light dusting of extra sugar.||5. If you use whole raisins or currants, they have a tendency to rise to the top of the cookies. When baked, they'll look like fruit exploded from the surface. While that's kind of fun, it's also hard to store effectively. You can get around that by properly mincing all your fruit. The sticky cut sides anchor to the pastry, helping the pieces stick in place.||6.   Bake your plum heavies at 350F / 180C for 15-18 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crunchy. They'll turn into a tough mess if refrigerated, so store them in a closed container (like a cookie jar) at room temperature for up to a week."	50	Easy						
Hot Buttered Scones	The Hobbit 	Hobbit Scones	"2.5*cups*Flour,1*teaspoon*Baking Powder,1*teaspoon*Cream of Tartar,2.5*tablespoon*Sugar,60*grams*Butter (cold),1*cup*Whole Milk"	"1. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cream of tartar, sugar, and salt. Once they're well mixed, add the butter. Use your fingers to work it into the flour in order to create crumbly edible gravel. The colder the butter, the better your scones.||2. Once the butter and flour are deliciously crumbly, moisten them up with the milk. Mix the dough until everything is barely combined, then lightly knead the dough a handful of times. You don't want to overwork it.||3.  Spread some flour on a clean work surface. While you're at it, dust your hands. Use them to press the dough so it's about 2 inches / 5 cm thick. Use a round or fluted round cookie cutter to punch out discs of tasty goodness. You usually see them about 3 inches / 7.5 cm across, but you can use whatever size cutters you own.||4. Arrange the scones 2 inches / 5 cm apart on a well greased baking sheet. Don't be shy about the butter.||5.  While you're at it, melt a little extra butter and paint it on top of your scones. Now that the scones are sitting on a buttery surface and topped with buttery goodness, let them rest for about 5 minutes before baking.||6.   Bake at 425F / 220C for 15-20 minutes, or until the tops are a delicious golden brown.||7.  These are best served piping hot, straight from the oven, with a dab of clotted cream or fresh raspberry jam. If you decide to take some along on an adventure, remember they won't last more than a day without going horribly stale. Make sure to slather the exterior in butter before toasting day old scones for a light breakfast."	50	Medium						
Roast Rack of Lamb	The Hobbit 	Marinated Lamb Ribs	"1*null*Frenched Rack of Lamb ( with 8 ribs),1*tablespoon*Cooking Oil,2*cloves*Garlic (minced),1*tablespoon*Fresh Rosemary Leaves,1*teaspoon*Fresh Thyme,1*teaspoon*Kosher Salt,0.5*teaspoon*Fresh Ground Black Pepper,1*tablespoon*Sherry,0.5*teaspoon*Apple Cider Vinegar,0.5*teaspoon*Dark Mustard"	"1. Mix everything but the lamb until you have a thick paste.||2. Trim the rack of lamb of excess fat. Leave a layer no more than 1 inch / 2.5 cm thick. Rub the spice paste all over the meat. You can now either let it rest on the counter for two hours until it reaches room temperature or wrap the whole thing in plastic and put it back in the fridge to marinate overnight. If you do, take it out two hours before you're ready to bake. It's important you let the meat return to room temperature before baking. If you don't, you could end up with burned fat, a raw centre and overall uneven badness.||3. When your nicely crusted lamb is at room temperature, preheat your oven to 400F / 205C.||4.   Put a roasting rack in the bottom of a pan that's not too much bigger than the rack itself. Arrange the rack of lamb fat side up/bone side down in the middle of the pan. Since you probably have less practice roasting a lamb than most Victorian cooks, you might want to insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat so you'll know when your lamb is done.||5. Roast the lamb for 7-8 minutes then reduce the temperature to 300F / 150C. Cook for another 7-15 minutes, depending on how done you like it. For rare lamb, pull it out when the internal temperature reaches 125F / 52C. If you prefer medium rare, let it cook until it reaches 135F / 57C. You don't want to leave it in much past that or else instead of a lovely juicy cut of meat, you'll end up needing a hacksaw to get through it all.||6.   Residual heat will keep cooking the meat, so seriously, don't leave it in the oven for more than 22 minutes total. As soon as you take the rack out of the oven, baste it in its juices. Remove the rack to a plate and wrap it in foil (or, if you want to be more period, put it on the counter, flip over a clean pan, and put it over the lamb to keep it warm. Let the meat rest for 20 minutes.||7. While the lamb rests, put the roasting pan over your oven burners. (If you didn't use a burner-safe pan, do your best to scrape all the juices and lovely crunchy bits out of the pan and into a skillet.)||8.   Over medium heat, deglaze the roasting pan with your sherry. Stir frequently to get up all the good bits. Add the cider vinegar and dark mustard and keep stirring until you have a thick, gloriously fatty gravy.||9.  Once the lamb has rested for 20 minutes, cut it into four thick chops if you're feeling generous or eight smaller chops if you're hosting unexpected company."	55	Easy						
Rosemary Skillet Peas 	The Hobbit 	Delicious pea side dish	"2*cups*Frozen Green Peas,3*tablespoons*Butter,1*tablespoon*Dried Rosemary,1*large*Garlic Clove (minced),2*teaspoons*Coarse Salt"	"1. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter is melted, add your frozen peas and give them a good stir so they're completely coated. Cook your peas, stirring often, for 5-6 minutes, or until they're completely thawed and warmed through but not yet soft or mushy.||2.   Sprinkle the rosemary, garlic, and salt on top. Give it all a good stir and continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes or until the garlic barely starts to brown.||3. If you add the rosemary and garlic too soon, they'll burn by the time the peas are fully cooked. You want them in the butter long enough to add flavour without any tragic consequences.||4.  This recipe can be easily doubled if you're serving plenty of guests or your well trained family really loves their vegetables."	15	Easy						
Stuffed and Roasted Mushrooms 	The Hobbit 	Cheesy sausage stuffed mushrooms	"4*large*Portabella Mushroom Caps,0.5*tablespoon*Butter,1*cup*Country Sausage,1*medium*Onion (diced),1*clove*Garlic (minced),1*teaspoon*Salt,1*teaspoon*Dried Herbs (rosemary or basil),0.5*teaspoon*Fresh Ground Pepper,1*null*Egg (beaten),280*grams*Dried Breadcrumbs,0.5*cup*Mozzarella Cheese (shredded) "	"1. Gently wash the mushroom caps and remove any remaining bits of stem. Let them sit out on a rack to dry while you brown the sausage.||2. Melt half a tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook your breakfast sausage until browned through. Once fully browned, add it to a mixing bowl. In the same skillet, add your diced onion, minced garlic, dried herbs, salt, and pepper. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the onion is translucent and the garlic starts to brown. Add it to the mixing bowl full of sausage.||3. Once the mix is cool enough to touch, add the beaten egg. Use your hands to knead the sausage, vegetables, and herbs together with the egg binder. Once they're all mixed, add all but 4 tbsp of breadcrumbs and keep mixing until the crumbs have soaked up a lot of the moisture.||4. Divide the mix into four parts. Gently press each one into a mushroom cap, taking care not to split the mushroom.||5.  Sprinkle each mushroom with 1 tbsp of reserved breadcrumbs. Then add a couple of tablespoons of shredded cheese.||6.  Bake at 350F / 180C for 15 minutes-18 minutes. Let cool slightly before eating.||7. For a more modest Shire inspired meal, serve these alongside mashed potatoes, green peas cooked with rosemary, and a hunk of fresh bread"	45	Easy						
Boxty on the Griddle 	The Hobbit 	Fried Irish Potato Bread	"450*grams*Bacon,2*cups*Potatoes (peeled and grated),2*cups*Potatoes (mashed),1.5*cups*Flour,1*tablespoon*Coarse Salt,1*teaspoon*Fresh Ground Black Pepper,1*teaspoon*Baking Powder,1.25*cups*Whole Milk,55*grams*Butter (melted),2*tablespoons*Butter "	"1. Grab your largest skillet and fry up an entire pound of bacon until crispy. This should leave you with a pan full of delicious juices. Set the bacon aside.||2. While the bacon is frying, peel and grate the raw potatoes until you have 2 cups of shreds. Soak them in cold water for five minutes to wash away the excess starch. Drain the potatoes then refresh them in more cold water.||3. Mix your flour, salt, pepper, and baking powder in a large bowl. Once those are well blended, add your mashed potatoes, whole milk, and melted butter. Keep mixing until you have a thick, pancake-like batter. Strain the shredded potatoes and add them to the party, mixing just enough to evenly distribute them in the batter.||4.  The next part requires patience. To make one large, family style boxty, you need slow, low, steady heat. Leave your bacon grease filled skillet at a steady medium, no hotter. Pour the batter in and spread it around the skillet until you have a single, giant pancake, no more than half an inch / 1.25 cm thick. If you have any leftover batter, get out a second skillet and make some baby boxtys fried in butter.||5. Let the big boxty cook for about ten minutes. You can use a spatula to peek under the edge in order to make sure it isn't burning, but do your best to just leave it in peace. Once the underside is a nice, golden brown, carefully slide it out onto a plate.||6.  Add the last 2 tbsp of butter to the pan and let it melt. Now carefully, quickly, put the buttered pan on top of your plate and flip it over so the raw batter side goes splat down onto the hot skillet.||7. Put the boxty back on medium heat and let it continue cooking for another 10 minutes or until golden brown on both sides.||8. Slide your glorious disc of boxty onto a large plate. Remember all that bacon you fried? Tear it into small pieces and pile them on top of the boxty. "	40	Easy

Sort your carrots to find the ones that are no more than 1 inch / 2.5 cm wide and 6 inches / 15 cm long. Alternately, you could simply cut your carrots into evenly sized pieces, but sometimes it's fun to be a presentation snob. Peel the carrots and cut off any woody end pieces.||2. Melt the butter in a wide bottomed stockpot. Add the beef broth, crushed garlic cloves, and fresh kitchen herbs. Give it all a good stir and bring the broth to a boil.||3.  Now add your carrots in a single layer and roll them around in the broth a bit. Turn the heat down to medium and let them simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until the carrots are fork-tender. Gently turn them every five minutes to make sure the carrots stay evenly coated.||4.  Once the carrots are nice and tender, remove them with a slotted spoon. Try to keep them intact for presentation purposes.||5. Turn the heat back up on the broth. Keep boiling until it's reduced to a glaze. Fish out the cloves and any whole herbs then pour the glaze on top of the carrots. "	30	Easy

Cherry Blossom Tempura 	Genshin	The subtle floral flavor of cherry blossoms will serve to elevate this classic tempura dish.

Pat all the vegetables and shrimp dry with a paper towel and set aside.||2. Add the oil to a deep fryer or a medium pot on the stovetop and heat to 320 degrees F. (Use a thermometer to check the temperature, or dip the tip of a wooden or bamboo chopstick in the oil. If small bubbles appear around the chopstick, the oil is ready.)||3. While the oil is heating, prepare the tempura batter. Place the all-purpose flour in a large bowl. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the ice water and egg until fully combined. Scoop up and discard any surface foam.||4. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the flour while mixing with chopsticks or a wire whisk. Once all the egg mixture is in, continue whisking gently for about 15 seconds. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay to leave some lumps in your batter. It's important to keep the tempura batter cold, so set your bowl of batter inside a larger bowl filled with about 1 inch of ice water.||5. When the oil reaches the right temperature, start by dipping an eggplant slice in the cold batter, letting any excess batter drip off for a few seconds before very gently placing the eggplant in the hot oil. Repeat this with each individual ingredient you're going to deep fry, but make sure you don't overcrowd the deep fryer or cooking pot. The ingredients should take up only half of the surface area at any time. (Having too many ingredients in the pot at once will cause the oil temperature to drop.)||6. Deep-fry the vegetables and shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes each and the sakura petals or nettle leaves for 15 to 20 seconds, or until golden. Continue frying in batches until all the ingredients have been cooked, transferring each batch to a baking sheet or plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Between batches, skim any leftover tempura crumbs from the top of the oil so they don't burn and change the flavor of the oil.||7. Serve the tempura immediately with wasabi and/or soy sauce for dipping."	70	Hard

Use the chopsticks or tongs to keep the pork fully submerged in the oil until the underside is golden brown, about 1 minute. Gently flip and cook the other side until it is also golden brown, about 1 more minute. Then transfer the cutlet to the prepared wire rack over the paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pork cutlets.||7. Drizzle tonkatsu sauce over the cutlets and let rest for a few minutes.

Don't let it boil, or the cream will start to separate from the rest of the liquid.||6. While the soup warms cut the middles out of your pretzel buns with a small knife. Cut about 3/4 of the way through the bun (if you cut all the way to the bottom, the soup is more likely to soak through). Spoon the finished soup into the bun bowls and top with sharp cheddar and fresh chives.||7. Enjoy warm while comparing Diagon Alley purchases with your wizarding buddies."	30	Easy

Glazed Terracotta Cookies 	Minecraft	 Some preplanning and rolling of various colored doughs will give you artful cookies that almost look too good to eat.	"1*cup*Unsalted Butter,1*cup*Granulated Sugar,1*null*Egg,1*teaspoon*Vanilla,3*cups*Flour,2*teaspoons*Baking Powder,0.5*teaspoon*Kosher Salt,1*packet*Gel Food Colouring (of choice)"	"1.

Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl, then slowly add into the wet mixture until everything is fully mixed.||4. Divide the dough into separate small bowls, one for each color you want to include in your tile. You might want to sketch out the design of your tile to guide you through the next steps. Or improvise and see what happens!||5. Place a few drops of gel food coloring into each bowl and mix with the dough until it reaches your desired color. (You may want to wear gloves to prevent your hands from getting stained!)||6. Roll each batch of colored dough into a long cylinder. Youre going to stack them together to form a single, thicker cylinder; slices of the cylinder will become your tiles. Consult your sketch, if you have one, and stack the tubes of dough on top of each other lengthwise so the colors line up where you want them. Look at the end of tube to see what the cross section will look like.||7. If you want your tile to include a specific shape in the center, you can roll one of the colored dough batches flat and cut out shapes with a cookie cutter. Stack the shapes on top of each other. Roll the other dough batches into long cylinders and use them to fill in the spaces around the cutout stack, creating a log with the cutout shape inside.||8. With the colors arranged correctly, press the dough together and form everything into a single cylinder.||9. Take the full log of dough and flatten it on four sides, creating a squared column. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.||10. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.||11. Take the log from the refrigerator and slice it into half-inch tiles. Place them on the baking sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until set and barely golden on the edges. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."	100	Hard
