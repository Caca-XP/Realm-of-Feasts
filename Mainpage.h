* \section intro_sec Introduction
*Realm of Feasts is a fantasy recipe discovery app that helps you find recipes based on the ingredients you already have at home.
*Realm of Feast searches its database and suggests the recipes you can make.
*The unique aspect of the app is that all recipes are of foods not from “Earth”.
*The app database includes recipes from Harry Potter, The Hobbit, Spirited Away, and many other mythical fictional realms.
*Thus, the name "Realm of Feasts." We have brought together all the different foods from different realms into one place so that others who enjoy fiction can feast upon it.
